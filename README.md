# OnTheMap
Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Project 3

Created an app with a map that shows information posted by other students with three view controllers: Log View,
Map and Table Tabbed View and Information Posting View.

Developed pins that show the location where other students have reported studying and by tapping on the pin users
can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. Built for users to add their own data by posting a string
that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL through Core Location and the MapKit framework.

Generated functions to post and retrieve data from a network resource using Appleâ€™s cut-edge networking framework
and authenticate a user over a connection through RESTful networked APIs.
